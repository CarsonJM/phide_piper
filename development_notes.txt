Pipeline To Do:
- Flesh out modules 8-12
- Annotate config.yaml file for modules 8-12
- Add ability to split virus file for iphop
- Change virus quality figure to boxplot
- Change virus identification output format
- Change host output format
- Add additional HMM databases to DRAMv
- Get all MetaPop visualizations
- pin genomad environment
- pin deepvirfinder environment
- pin checkv environment
- pin jupyter environment
- pin phist environment
- pin iPhoP environment
- containerize entire workflow

Benchmarking To Do:
- Benchmark virus enrichment (virome vs bulk)
- Benchmark virus identification (Individual vs combined)
- Benchmark virus quality (HQ, MQ, all viruses)
- Benchmark virus recovery/chimera
- Benchmark virus host PHIST, iPHoP, and vOTU (HQ, MQ, all viruses)
- Benchmark virus taxonomy MMseqs2 & geNomad (HQ, MQ, all viruses)
- Benchmark virus lifestyle (HQ, MQ, all viruses)
- Benchmark virus abundance (breadth & depth)
- Analyze TIP samples with pipeline
- Analyze SA isolates with pipeline


Pipeline overview:
1. Read preprocessing
- Fastp (trimming, deduplication)
- KneadData (human read removal)
- MultiQC (preprocessing report)

2. Virus Enrichment
